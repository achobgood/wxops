# Webex Calling Playbook

Build and configure any aspect of Webex Calling programmatically with guided Claude Code assistance.
Uses two Python libraries: `wxc_sdk` (official Cisco SDK) and `wxcadm` (admin-focused with XSI/CP-API).

## Quick Start

Run `/wxc-calling-builder` to start building. The agent walks you through authentication, interviews you about what you want to build, designs a deployment plan, executes the API calls, and verifies the results.

## If Debugging

Run `/wxc-calling-debug` to troubleshoot a failing configuration.

## Reference Doc Sources

All reference docs are grounded in actual source code and official documentation:

- **wxc_sdk v1.30.0** (github.com/jeokrohn/wxc_sdk) — cloned at `../wxc_sdk_reference/`
- **wxcadm v4.6.1** (github.com/kctrey/wxcadm) — cloned at `../wxcadm_reference/`
- **developer.webex.com** — Official API docs, guides, and blog posts
- **Cisco Live LTRCOL-2574** — Hands-on provisioning lab

Items marked `<!-- NEEDS VERIFICATION -->` need confirmation against live API behavior.
Known bugs found in wxcadm source are documented in the reference docs.

Maintainers: update reference docs when you discover new gotchas or API changes.

## Reference Doc Sync Protocol

This repo contains authoritative reference docs at `docs/reference/` that document every Webex Calling API surface. These docs were built from wxc_sdk and wxcadm source code and serve both the CLI and the playbook agent.

### When you learn something new

Whenever you discover a technical detail through implementation — a gotcha, a correction, an undocumented behavior, a scope requirement, a parameter that works differently than expected — do this:

1. **Check the relevant reference doc first.** Use the See Also links at the bottom of each doc to find related docs. Key docs by area:
   - Provisioning: `docs/reference/provisioning.md`
   - Call features (AA/CQ/HG): `docs/reference/call-features-major.md`, `call-features-additional.md`
   - Person settings: `docs/reference/person-call-settings-*.md` (4 files: handling, media, permissions, behavior)
   - Location settings: `docs/reference/location-call-settings-*.md` (3 files: core, media, advanced)
   - Devices: `docs/reference/devices-*.md` (3 files: core, dect, workspaces)
   - Routing: `docs/reference/call-routing.md`
   - Auth: `docs/reference/authentication.md`
   - SDK patterns: `docs/reference/wxc-sdk-patterns.md`

2. **If the reference doc is wrong or incomplete**, update it:
   - Fix incorrect method signatures, scopes, or data models
   - Add the gotcha to the doc's Gotchas section (create one if missing)
   - If you resolved a `<!-- NEEDS VERIFICATION -->` tag, remove it and replace with the verified info
   - Add a comment: `<!-- Verified via CLI implementation YYYY-MM-DD -->`

3. **If the reference doc is right**, move on — no action needed.

4. **If there's no reference doc for what you found**, add it to the closest doc's Gotchas section with a note about which command surfaced it.
