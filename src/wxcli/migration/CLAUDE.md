# migration/ — CUCM→Webex Migration Tool

All 11 phases complete. **1642 tests passing.** Wired into the CLI as `wxcli cucm <command>`. Does NOT use the auto-generator.

| `.claude/skills/cucm-migrate/SKILL.md` | Phase 11 — 6-step execution skill: preflight → plan summary → batch execute → delegate → report |

**Where the design spec and pipeline architecture docs conflict, the pipeline architecture docs are authoritative.**

Each subdirectory has its own CLAUDE.md (local context) and TODO.md (outstanding work).
See `docs/plans/cucm-migration-roadmap.md` for the master project status.

## Known Issues

1. **CUCM CallPickupGroup creation with members fails on CUCM 15.0.** The AXL `addCallPickupGroup` operation with `<members>` containing `<directoryNumber>` fails with a null priority foreign key constraint (`pickupgroupmember.priority`). Workaround: create the pickup group empty, then use `updateLine` with `callPickupGroupName` to assign members at the line level. Affects both wxcadm and raw AXL calls. <!-- Verified on CUCM 15.0.1.13901(2), 2026-03-24 -->

## Pipeline Commands

## Hoteling / Hot Desking Migration

The `DeviceProfileMapper` produces execution-ready hoteling data alongside the
existing `FEATURE_APPROXIMATION` decisions. For each CUCM Extension Mobility
device profile it sets `hoteling_guest_enabled=True` (when the user is resolved),
populates `location_canonical_id` (from device_pool → location cross-ref), and
creates a `hoteling_location:{loc_cid}` MigrationObject for each unique location
with EM phones. Three new execution handlers (`enable_hoteling_guest`,
`enable_hoteling_host`, `enable_hotdesking`) configure Webex hoteling guest,
device host, and location-level voice portal sign-in respectively. Advisory
pattern 20 (`detect_extension_mobility_usage`) escalates severity to MEDIUM when
profiles contain multi-line or BLF features that Webex hot desking cannot
replicate, and `recommend_feature_approximation` always recommends "accept" for
EM decisions (no alternative architecture exists). Spec at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-hoteling-migration.md`.

**To run a migration:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `decisions` → `plan` → `preflight` → `export` → then invoke `/cucm-migrate`.

**To generate an assessment report:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` (or `discover --from-file`) → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `report --brand "..." --prepared-by "..."`. Does not require plan/preflight/export — the report reads directly from the post-analyze store.

**To generate a per-user diff:** `wxcli cucm init` → `discover` → `normalize` → `map` → `analyze` → `user-diff`. Does not require plan/preflight/export.
